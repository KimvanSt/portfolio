    "## Places to live\n",
    "In this exercise we will answer questions about the hometowns of our target population.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many people live in Amsterdam?\n",
    "2. What are the street names of people living in postal code number 7311? \n",
    "3. In which cities are streets containing the name 'Willem'? Alphabetically ordered result. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start with question one: according to www.postcode-adresboek.nl the postal codes of Amsterdam are 1011 to 1109. We need to find these codes in the text-file in combination with the word 'Amsterdam'. We're looking for four numbers, than one or no space, and then two letters, followed by a space and then 'Amsterdam' (possibly with additions, which wouldn't matter). The first two digits are 1 and then a 0 or 1.\n",
    "\"1 : the first number is 1\n",
    "[0|1]: the second number is 0 or 1\n",
    "\\d{2}: followed by two random digits \n",
    "\\s?: Then one or zero spaces\n",
    "[A-Z]{2}: Then two capitals between A and Z\n",
    "\\sAmsterdam: then a space and the word Amsterdam\n",
    "\n",
    "I will also make a function that uses a pattern to go through the data, and adds the found data to a list. This, because I might have to do the same action several times in this notebook. I also import the regex module, open the file and go though it line by line until I find something that matches the pattern. I'll add it to the list and request the length of the list: this way I will get the number of postal codes in Amsterdam."

We'll make a group (which is: (?P<groupname>) ) for the streetname and -number, so that we can easily retrieve it later. We'll say that the streetname can consist of anything (\".\\*\") and the -number of any amount of digits (\"\\d*\"), divided by a space (\\s). On the new line will be the postal code 7311 (\\n7311). In the above cel I already imported and divided the data by new lines, so that the results would look better, but I have to revert it now: otherwise the code will read the file line by line and my pattern wouldn't work.
