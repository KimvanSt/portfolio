# Kim van Stratum's portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! Here, I will attempt to showcase some of the projects I have been working on. 

## Podcast analysis and generator

I analyzed a database with three sets of data on podcasts. These were interlinked by a podcast ID. I retreived and cleaned the data and analyzed which genres were getting most and higher reviews. I also built a random-podcast-generator that gives the user a podcast based on a chosen genre and subgenre, if any.

## Dutch train times and stations

I used the API of the Dutch national train company to gather the next departures and corresponding final destinations, if any. I filtered out unuseable data and any non-Dutch train station. 

## Python

In the spring of 2022 I attended a course at Bit Academy where I learned Python by executing several simple projects. These are a few examples: 
1. I built a basic calculator
2. I wrote the well-known 'FizzBuzz' code
3. Gauss
4. I used a pre-written code by another programmer to write a lootbox-opening code
5. I coded a roulette game
6. I wrote a Pokémon catcher

## Data collection, cleaning and analysis

In the Bit Academy course we also worked with collecting, cleaning data. These are a few sample projects I worked on: 
1. I wrote code to find a target piece if information in an .nbt file
2. I used Regex to find specific people from a large .txt file with address data
3. I used Selenium to scrape Amazon for a certain type of laptop, using user input to determine the final page
4. I analyzed various parameters of a large amount of Pokémon
